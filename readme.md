A simple executable that renames image files based on keywords that describe the image. The keywords are generated using [Ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai). You must have Ollama installed first.

## Installation

1. Find the latest release for your OS [here](https://github.com/technovangelist/obm/releases/latest/)
2. Rename it to something memorable, like airenamer (or airenamer.exe on Windows).
3. Ensure it is executable. On Linux or Mac, run `chmod +x airenamer`.
4. Move the file somewhere into your path.
5. Again, make sure you have [Ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) installed.

## Usage

Navigate to a folder with some images in it and run `airenamer`.

Make sure you have a backup first. It only copies the files, but I'm not responsible for any data loss.
